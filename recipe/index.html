      <h2>Baked Apple with Crisp Topping</h2>
      <p>
        1) Preheat oven to 180C/Gas Mark 4. 2) Cut each apple in half along its
        equator. Using a melon baller, cut out each side of the core, creating a
        rounded hole. Rub exposed apple flesh with lemon juice. Place 1
        tablespoon of jam into each hole. 3) For the topping: in a small bowl
        mix together flour, butter, brown sugar, oats, cinnamon and salt. Press
        this mixture on the top of each apple, covering jam. 4) Place in a
        baking dish filled with about a 1-cm of water. Bake until top is golden
        brown and apple is tender, about 35 to 40 minutes.
